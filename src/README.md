## How to run it
The modules it requires to run are:
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.13.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "sass": "^1.63.3",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
axios has been installed for later but is not required as of now

if all modules are installed just typing npm start in the console where the file is open should start it.
