      "description": "After having been empty for many years, a prestigious old estate has been put up for sale. Despite its worth, it has had a hard time selling as there are many rumors swirling around the grounds. Because of this, there is to be an open house so potential buyers can explore the grounds, see its splendor, and set their fears to rest. Thereâ€™s nothing strange here right? Each of the party is in some way connected to a very wealthy inventor and collector, who, upon hearing of this, contracted them to enter the grounds on the night of the open house and retrieve several tomes for him ...they should be in the library right?
